    <h2>Congressmen</h2>
    <p>The major power of the House is to pass federal legislation that affects the entire country, although its bills
        must also be passed by the Senate and further agreed to by the U.S. President before becoming law (unless both
        the House and Senate re-pass the legislation with a two-thirds majority in each chamber). The House has some
        exclusive powers: the power to initiate revenue bills, to impeach officials (impeached officials are
        subsequently tried in the Senate), and to elect the U.S. President in case there is no majority in the Electoral
        College.</p>
    <p>Each U.S. state is represented in the House in proportion to its population as measured in the census, but every
        state is entitled to at least one representative. </p>
